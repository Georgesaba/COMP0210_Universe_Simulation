## Section 1.2

In `include/particle.hpp` and `lib/particle.cp`p I have outlined two classes. `particle` is responsible for defining characteristics of a single particle, and `particle_group` is reponsible for describing a collection of particles. The `particle` class has a size 3 velocity std::array member variable which is set to all zero values and a size 3 position std::array member variable. Its constructor sets an initial position for it. All member variables are public so that individual coordinates can be changed independently without having to replace the whole position or velocity array every time it is accessed. The `particle_group` class has particle mass and the number of particles stored as member variables as well as an std::vector of particle objects to store all the particle specific particle information. I have chosen this format so that I can store the features that every particle has only once and then bundle the features each particle has in a single object for ease of use. The std::vector is used to store the particle objects as it stores data on the heap making it suitable for extremely large numbers of particles. This also has performance benefits as all the qualities of a particle can be accessed with a single memory access of a vector instead of indexing vectors multiple times. This is especially true of larger vectors where the data in question may be stored outside of the cache. I decided to make constructors that work with different argument combinations by taking advantage of constructor overloading. The first constructor allows for the position of each particle to be set individually through passing an std::vector of length 3 std::arrays containing the x, y and z coordinates of the particle and the second constructor gives the particles random positions between 0 and 1 for each x, y and z particle coordinates. Both constructors assign the particle mass and the number of particles for the collection of particles.
